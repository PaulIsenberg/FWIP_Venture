## Communication Protocol 

OUr primary mode of communication is through our Slack group. Through Slack we discuss a good time for all of us to meet over Zoom. Generally we meet about once a day to once very two days. Our Zoom meetings last about an hour to an hour and a half depending on what tasks need to be completed. Through Zoom we were able to establish each person's role on the team. In addition, we have a shared Google Doc where we jot down any notes we have for the project, for each other, and any notes we may have received from the instructors and TA's.
