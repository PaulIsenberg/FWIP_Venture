## Communication Protocol 

Our primary mode of communication is through our Slack group. Through Slack we discuss a good time for all of us to meet over Zoom. Generally we meet about once a day to once very two days. Our Zoom meetings last about an hour to an hour and a half depending on what tasks need to be completed. Through Zoom we were able to establish each person's role on the team. In addition, we have a shared Google Doc where we jot down any notes we have for the project, for each other, and any notes we may have received from the instructors and TA's.


## Presentation Outline

#### Selected Topic   
  
After some extensive searches through Kaggle, we settled on Startup Investments data. The majority of the team has a background in finance and the dataset piqued our interest. Also, after this course the majority of us want to pursue a career and this might steer us in the direction of what types of companies to join or avoid. In addition, we felt that we could apply machine learning technologies after cleaning and merging the data. The csvâ€™s each have at least one primary key that should allow us to combine the datasets for when we start preprocessing.
